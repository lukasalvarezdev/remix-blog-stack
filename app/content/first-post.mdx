Minimalism is about removing the excess and focusing on what truly matters. By decluttering your
life—whether it's physical items, relationships, or commitments—you create space for what brings
you joy. The less you own, the less you worry about maintaining. It's not about deprivation;
it’s about making room for experiences, growth, and peace.
